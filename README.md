# 📧 Email Spam Detector

A machine learning web application that classifies email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using natural language processing and a Naive Bayes classifier. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask, this project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow—from data preprocessing to model deployment in a browser-based interface.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Spam emails reduce productivity and pose security risks. Can we automatically classify them using machine learning?

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Build a spam classifier using ML algorithms (Naive Bayes or SVM)
- Preprocess email text using NLP techniques
- Achieve 90%+ accuracy on test data
- Deploy a lightweight web app for real-time predictions

---

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Naive Bayes classification
- Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall
- Flask-based web interface for user input and prediction
- Ready for deployment on platforms like Render or Heroku
